# Vision-Based-Obstacle-Detection-System
• Developed a vision-based obstacle detection system using YOLOv8 for autonomous drone navigation.   • Processed real-time video frames using OpenCV and NumPy.   • Implemented decision logic to suggest directional movement (left/right/up) based on object position.   • Displayed bounding boxes on detected obstacles.
